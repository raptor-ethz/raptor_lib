Implement raptor msgs in
- logger

Check integration in interface
- how is the feedback sent?
- check action in offboard loop
- reset action command when offboard is trigerred

mocap checks in onboard px4_mocap_pub

Quad::land sequence
- actions.243 -> message to terminate offboard
- actions.231 -> check offset, and wait if not within tolerance

Check interface conversion long to int

Failsafe Tests:
- recordings
- protocol

Make command messages private
-> setter with assertion

Idea: Move initialization inside of constructor?
Problem: feedback?

idea: change coordinate arguments to arrays
