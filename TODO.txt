Check gripper implementation with aurel
- max angle?

add hover action message

Implement raptor msgs in
- logger
- emergency

Quad::land sequence
- actions.243 -> message to terminate offboard

- protocol

Make command messages private

Problem: feedback?

idea: change coordinate arguments to arrays
