Check gripper implementation with aurel
- max angle?

Implement raptor msgs in
- logger
- emergency

Gripper
- getter of max angle
- use that in emergency land 

Check integration in interface
- how is the feedback sent?
- check action in offboard loop

Check interface is connected

Quad::land sequence
- actions.243 -> message to terminate offboard
- actions.231 -> check offset, and wait if not within tolerance

Failsafe Tests:
- recordings
- protocol

Make command messages private
-> setter with assertion

Idea: Move initialization inside of constructor?
Problem: feedback?

idea: change coordinate arguments to arrays
